Good Day,


My name is eamadit, I would like to find collaborators for the following projects:

1. Build a new open source decentralized and collaborative non-pyramidal DNS PKI model based on Wireguard

2. Build an open source VPS hosting server architecture model in order to offer VPS hosting with shared IPs, management interface secured with authenticator and recovery interface secured with emails and/or phone numbers

3. Build a SDNS public resolver

4. Build a liberal decentralized and collaborative open source search engine model without discriminatory blacklist

5. Build exploits based on security red flags which allows to shutdown the television network

6. Build exploits which allows to destroy AI-driven cyberattack hardware and software on the internet. A cyberattack is not only a computer attack, it is a cybernetic attack, there are also social engineering aspects mostly driven by satellite-based phonon laser mind control which simulates brain reading. O3B satellites are powered with solid-state amplifiers, which probably benefits from the scientifically established overunity.

7. Build an open source incorruptible views/listenings counter for streaming platforms and web pages.
