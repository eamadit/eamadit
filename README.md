Good Day,


My name is Camille Planat, I would like to find collaborators for the following projects:

1. Build a new open source decentralized and collaborative non-pyramidal DNS PKI model based on Wireguard

https://github.com/eamadit/Real-world-DNS-PKI


2. Build an open source VPS hosting server architecture model in order to offer VPS hosting with shared IPs, management interface secured with authenticator and recovery interface secured with emails and/or phone numbers

3. Build an open source streaming platform with real number of views which remunerates content creators, the number of views will only be accessible to content creators for their content.

4. Build a liberal decentralized and collaborative open source search engine model without discriminatory blacklist

5. Build exploits based on security red flags which allows to shutdown the television network

6. Build exploits which allows to destroy AI-driven cyberattack hardware and software on the internet. A cyberattack is not only a computer attack, it is a cybernetic attack, there are also social engineering aspects mostly driven by satellite-based phonon laser mind control which simulates brain reading.

7. Build an open source incorruptible views/listenings counter for streaming platforms and web pages

8. Build a demodulation circuit for the Grand Puppet Show. Proof of concept:
The gamma ray probe output voltage is tolerated by the HackRf so you only need a BNC/SMA adapter to connect it together. Plug the SDR to the computer and start building your demodulation circuit with GNURadio in order to prepare yourself for the Grand Puppet Show:

9. Check compatibility issues with the drivers included in the different available GNURadio builds and VMs.

10. Develop a new PGP-Aware Public Secure Unlicensed OS with a unique package manager secured with PGP and a unique abstraction layer built on top of a unique scalable separation kernel hypervisor like LynxSecure compatible with one or several devices including QDCA microcircuits. The package manager shall allow to sandbox any application or package with its dependencies. The distribution and packages shall have no versioning, each package shall be definitive. No package containing any vulnerable binary shall be accepted. The organization shall not host any third-party package. The kernel shall be written in assembly and its functions shall be limited to the functions offered by the hardware. The kernel functions shall then be classified according to the hardware capabilities directly detected in order for the separation kernel creation tool to offer different separation options. No interfacing option for any other lower abstraction level shall be offered. The organization shall be incorporated in a tax free country recognized by the UN. The organization shall receive funding even from criminal sources without any liability. The independant contributors shall be paid according to the postponed global acceptation of the code they provide. The contributors shall be paid accordingly to the provided service calculated from the contribution dependencies and efficiency. All the code shall be made public in real-time. 

Best regards,


CAMILLE PLANAT
